# AI-Powered Help Website Q&A Agent

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered question-answering agent** that processes documentation from help websites and accurately answers user queries about **product features, integrations, and functionality**. The agent performs **recursive web crawling**, extracts structured documentation, indexes it using **semantic search**, and generates precise responses using **Gemini AI**.

## Features
- ✅ Accepts a **help website URL** and crawls documentation pages recursively.
- ✅ Extracts **meaningful content** while filtering out navigation elements.
- ✅ Implements **semantic search** to find the most relevant documentation.
- ✅ Calls **Gemini AI** to generate **clear and precise answers**.
- ✅ Provides **source references** where applicable.
- ✅ Handles **network errors and unsupported websites** gracefully.
- ✅ Uses **unit tests** to validate functionality.

Snippet: Hi, how can we help? Common troubleshooting topics: notifications, connecting to Slack, huddles
-----
Agent is ready! Type a question (type 'exit' to quit):

> How do I create a channel on Slack?
I am sorry, but I cannot answer your question. However, related topics include "channel management", "moving channels", "shared channels", "public channels", and "private channels."

> How do I troubleshoot Slack connectivity issues?
To troubleshoot Slack connectivity issues, here are some common topics and potential solutions:
- **Check your internet connection:** Ensure you have a stable and active internet connection.
- **Whitelisting:** Ensure that Slack is whitelisted in your firewall or antivirus software.
- **Connecting:** Refer to the "connecting to Slack" topic for general guidance.

> How can I integrate Slack with other apps?      
To integrate Slack with other apps, you can connect, simplify, and automate using apps and tools. The context mentions several apps that can be integrated with Slack, such as Asana, Bitbucket, Dropbox, GitHub, Google Calendar, Jira, OneDrive, Zapier, Zoom, etc.
🔬 Running Unit Tests
Unit tests validate crawling, processing, and semantic search.

📑 Documentation
1️⃣ Technical Architecture Overview
Crawler (crawler.py): Recursively extracts documentation pages.
Processor (processor.py): Cleans HTML, extracts structured content, and generates embeddings.
Semantic Search (query.py): Uses Sentence Transformers for similarity matching.
Answer Generation (gemini_api.py): Calls Gemini AI to refine responses.
2️⃣ Implementation Approach
Extracts content only from structured sections (article, section, .help-content).
Semantic search prioritizes the best-matching sections.
LLM answer refinement improves response quality.
3️⃣ Future Improvement Suggestions
Expand to multiple documentation sources (e.g., Slack + Google Help).
Enhance query understanding (allow paraphrased questions).
Add API support (for integration into web apps).
4️⃣ Testing Approach
Unit tests validate individual components.
Performance benchmarks track speed of crawling, processing, and answering.
📚 Third-Party Libraries Used
Library	Purpose
requests	Fetches web pages
beautifulsoup4	Parses and cleans HTML
sentence-transformers	Generates embeddings for search
numpy	Computes similarity scores
google-generativeai	Calls Gemini AI for answer refinement
⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
🔹 Assumptions
Help websites contain structured documentation sections (article, section).
Queries are clear and concise.
🔹 Limitations
Dynamic content is not fully handled (JavaScript-rendered content is not fetched).
Crawling is limited to avoid excessive server requests.
📝 Future Enhancements
Improve Answer Precision: Enhance Gemini prompt formatting.
Multi-Source Support: Allow querying across multiple documentation sites.
REST API Integration: Convert CLI tool into an API service.
